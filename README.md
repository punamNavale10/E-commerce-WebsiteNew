# E-commerce Website

Our e-commerce website utilizes a robust tech stack to deliver a seamless user experience. The frontend is crafted using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
combined with Django's templating engine for dynamic and responsive interfaces. Django serves as the backend, offering rapid development, security, and scalability through its 
Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. With SQLite as the default database engine, development is streamlined, allowing focus on key features such as user authentication, product
and order management, and responsive design for optimal accessibility across devices.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br>
Our frontend is built using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing us to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces. By combining these languages with Django's 
templating engine, we deliver a seamless browsing experience that is both intuitive and responsive across various devices.

Backend : Django
<br>
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and scalable web applications.
In Django, the architecture pattern used is called the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern, 
Models are Python classes that define the data schema and interact with the database, typically corresponding to a database table. 
Views are Python functions that process user requests, perform business logic, and return HTTP responses. They can generate HTML templates or JSON for API endpoints.
Templates, on the other hand, represent the presentation layer of the application, containing static layout and placeholders for dynamic content. They use Django's template language to generate HTML 
dynamically based on views' data, promoting code reusability and maintainability.


Database : SQLite
<br>
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained, and embedded SQL database engine, popular in development and testing environments due to its simplicity and ease of setup. It directly accesses 
database files, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications with low to moderate traffic. Django creates a default database configuration in the project's settings file, using SQLite as 
the database engine. SQLite databases are portable, allowing easy sharing or deployment with the application.
Overall, the default use of SQLite in Django simplifies the development process and allows developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about database setup 
and configuration.
